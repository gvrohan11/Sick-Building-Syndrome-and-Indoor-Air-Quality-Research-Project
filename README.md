# Sick-Building-Syndrome-and-Indoor-Air-Quality-Research-Project

NASA Summer Enhancement In Earth Sciences Research Internship - Summer 2020
Team: Covid-19 Increased Health & Safety Group
- Conducted research on Sick Building Syndrome and proposed a filter model solution 
- Modeled the filter using TinkerCAD and also modeled an Air Quality Monitor Using TinkerCAD
- Modeled our Filter based on the HEPA filter design and designed our monitor to detect particles using electroacoustic sensors
- Used a machine learning system to analyze the model's performance
